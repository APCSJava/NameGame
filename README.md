Starter code for the Name Game project

   /**
    * Provided a person's name (single word) the Name Game produces a rhyming
    * verse, as popularized by Shirley Ellis in her 1964 hit recording for Capital Records.
    *
    *
    * For example, provided the name Lisa
    * "Lisa, Lisa, bo-bisa
    *  Banana fanna fo-fisa
    *  Fee fie mo-misa
    *  Lisa!"
    *
    * The exact rules are available online and indicate special situations that arise when
    * a person's name begins with one of the target substitutions (b, f, or m).
